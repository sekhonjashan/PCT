For a given array of price of items,you have to calculate the sum and average of all prices upto 2 decimal places.

Input:
First line of the input contains an integer T which denotes the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.  Each test case contains two lines.
The first line of each test case contains N denoting the number of items in the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers - P1, P2, ..., PN denoting prices of items.

Output: 
For each test case, print space separated sum and average of all the items resepctively.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100
1<=Pi<=1000

Example:
Input:
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
9
2 55 85 656 52 554 545 5 2
